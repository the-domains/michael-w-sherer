A War Is Child’s Play…</b></p><p>An ex-Navy SEAL
parachutes onto a glacier in Greenland under cover of darkness. A Russian
admiral sails his Udaloy-class destroyer to the newly reopened air base on
Kotelny Island in the East Siberian Sea. A research scientist in Seattle
arranges a midnight meeting with an NCIS counterespionage agent. A navy
intelligence agent goes AWOL in a quest to clear her name of murder.</p><p>The only common thread
among them is unsuspecting newspaper delivery driver Blake Sanders. When the
scientist’s surreptitious rendezvous is interrupted by Russian <i data-grid-id="ce41a25c-9779-4ad5-a42c-9c244df48fb0">mafiosi </i>and goes bad, the wounded
scientist rabbits. Desperate to get away, he hijacks Blake’s car at gunpoint. Shortly
after, the man bleeds out in the back seat and dies, but not before giving
Blake a photo of a young girl and extracting a promise to find and protect her.</p><p>Carrying out that promise
launches Blake on a frenetic and dangerous race against time to find the girl
and the secret she holds, a secret that could put technology in the hands of
the Russians that will tip the balance of world military power. On the run from
NCIS, police, the Russian <i data-grid-id="0549f453-95c4-4f34-9edf-16a897710278">Organizitsaya,
</i>and even his former lover, naval intelligence officer Reyna Chase, Blake’s only
hope of stopping a secret plot against Putin that could put Russia and the US
at war is saving the girl. First, he has to stay alive…</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c80433e6-643e-4cc4-b332-a4f4c5e8abff.jpg"><p><i></i></p><p><i data-grid-id="7fd6615f-7564-46c4-b7d5-a2f81653db6d"><b data-grid-id="5832a445-42ca-4f0a-977a-06d031e432cd">What would you do to save someone you love?</b></i></p><p>More than a year after Blake Sanders’s life
fell apart he’s finally starting to pick up the pieces and put it all back
together. When his ex-wife Molly is abducted, he vows not to lose her, too. Her
high-profile law firm calls in the FBI, which treats the case as a
run-of-the-mill kidnap-for-ransom. But to Blake, it’s personal. When the
kidnappers demand that he deliver the ransom, he knows it is. </p><p>With Molly’s life hanging in the balance, Blake
does the unexpected, setting off a chain reaction and a game of cat-and-mouse
with the mastermind behind the abduction. The deeper Blake digs for answers,
the more apparent it becomes that money is lowest on the kidnappers’ list of
demands. </p><p>One of Molly’s clients is an ex-Navy SEAL, an
expert dolphin trainer turned animal rights activist. When he disappears the
stakes suddenly go up, and Blake asks naval intelligence officer Reyna Chase
for help. As soon as Reyna gets wind of what’s happening, the game changes from
saving Molly to saving Seattle from a terrorist threat that could wreak havoc
on the city and kill thousands. The only way Blake can stop it is to pay the
ransom—not with cash, but with his life. </p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/58460b18-0a3e-4a2d-b309-5e8d6c1711be.jpg"><p><b data-grid-id="6d0c5a64-9c7b-42a3-b170-afb6f223b06c">Blast From The Past…</b></p><p>Blake Sanders thought he left his Midwestern past behind
when he went to UW on a basketball scholarship more than 20 years earlier. But
Keely Radcliffe drags it back into the present when she shows up on Blake’s
stoop one morning to ask for his help. </p><p>Back then, Keely’s sister was killed in a lab explosion on a
university campus in southern Illinois. Blake’s best friend Perry Langford was
arrested and convicted of murder for setting the charge, but Langford always
maintained his innocence, claiming someone else blew up the building. Not even
Blake knows what really happened, and he was there, a secret he’s kept all this
time. Now Langford is out of prison, and he’s gunning for all those he holds
responsible for his 20-year stint in stir, including Blake. </p><p>A week later, Blake’s cop friend Charlie invites him to a
backyard barbecue at his folks’ house. Masked gunmen burst in on the
festivities before the two of them can even open a beer. Charlie and Blake
manage to hold off the marauders, but Charlie is wounded, and when the smoke
clears Charlie’s parents have vanished.</p><p>Events begin to snowball, putting Blake on the run from both
the shooters and Langford, his childhood friend, and Blake realizes they’re all
related. Soon the FBI and even naval intelligence officer Reyna Chase are on
his tail, too. Whoever planted the bomb 20 years ago is cleaning up loose ends,
and the prize they’re still seeking after all this time—a revolutionary battery
design—is worth a fortune, even worth selling out one’s own country…and killing
for.</p><picture>

<p>In the space of a few months, Blake Sanders lost his job,
his only son to suicide, and his marriage. Mired in depression and grief, he
can only face the world at night, washing dishes and delivering newspapers.</p><p>A year later, on a cold November night, Blake’s world is
turned upside down again when an elderly woman on his newspaper route is
brutally stabbed to death and Blake is charged with her murder.</p><p>In a desperate attempt to find the real killer, he learns
that his friend had stumbled onto secrets that have been buried beneath
Seattle’s Capitol Hill for 150 years. Secrets that are now being disturbed by
digging for the new light rail tunnel. Secrets that will shake the city’s
government. Secrets that foreign agents will kill for.</p><p>On the run from the police and murderers, Blake finds a
chance to heal his grief and reclaim his life. But only if he can stay alive
long enough to unearth the truth. </p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="13"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="14"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="15"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="16"><span data-reactid="17"><!-- react-empty: 18 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="19"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="20"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="23"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
